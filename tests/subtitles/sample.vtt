In this video, we're going to talk about how to scale your web-based Azure services.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.890
So in order to basically do this, obviously you need to have an Azure account

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.320
with some Azure mobile or web services deployed,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.580
and on the screen here, I'm logged into my test account.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.880
So if I was going to look at scaling,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.280
I would have to look at, again, one of the types of services I was just describing.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.280
But, you know, you can scale just about any of the services to be quite honest,
